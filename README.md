## Automatic drive/media shortcuts for your desktop 

Desk Drive™ solves a really annoying problem. You pop a USB thumb drive or DVD
into your computer and then you have to open Window’s Explorer and find the
mapped drive or folder. Desk Drive adds a desktop icon pointing to the drive
automatically. Remove the media and the shortcut goes away. Brilliantly simple
and effective.

Desk Drive sits quietly in the system tray. Configuration (image at right) is
just a click away and allows you to specify which types of media to monitor. So
simple, it just works. Download it today!
